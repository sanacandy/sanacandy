<p>es, space is mostly silent because sound waves cannot travel through the vacuum of space:
    No medium
    Sound waves require a medium, like air or water, to travel through. Space is mostly a vacuum, so there are no atoms or molecules to carry sound waves.
    Communication
    Astronauts use radio waves to communicate with each other while spacewalking. 
    However, space is not completely silent: 
    Electromagnetic vibrations
    The Sun's constant stream of charged particles produces ultra-low frequency electromagnetic vibrations. 
    Galaxy clusters
    Hot gases in galaxy clusters can act as a medium for sound to travel through. However, humans need to process or resynthesize these sounds to hear them. 
    Plasma
    Space is not a perfect vacuum, and it contains some particles in a physical state called plasma. In plasma, sound waves travel faster and have longer wavelengths. For example, NASA released an image in 2022 of sound waves around a black hole. </p>
<p>Einstein's theory of spacetime tells us that the real universe is not silent, but is actually alive with vibrating energy. Space and time carry a cacophony of vibrations with textures and timbres as rich and varied as the din of sounds in a tropical rain forest or the finale of a Wagner opera. It's just that we haven't heard those sounds yet. The universe is a musical that we've been watching all this time as a silent movie.</p>
